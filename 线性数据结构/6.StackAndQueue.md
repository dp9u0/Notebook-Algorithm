# 栈和队列

栈(Stack)和队列(Queue)是两种常用的数据结构,分别遵循*先进后出*与*先进先出*的出入原则.

## Stack

现代计算机方法(过程,函数)执行时,方法的局部变量即被管理在栈的数据结构上.

## Queue

消息系统中常见的数据结构,遵循先进先出(*First In First Out*)的原则.

此外还有优先队列(*Priority Queue*, *First In Largest Out*),但是优先队列不是线性数据结构,通常使用堆来实现,这里就不在详细展开了,具体后面再作介绍.

## 实践

### 用 Stack 实现 Queue

### 用 Queue 实现 Stack

### Stack 的使用

下面这个题目是Stack的使用的例子.

#### Description

```js
You're now a baseball game point recorder.
Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:
Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
"+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
"D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
"C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.
Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.
You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.
Example 1:
Input: ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.  
Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.
Example 2:
Input: ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27
Explanation:
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.  
Round 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.
Round 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.
Round 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.
Round 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points. The sum is 27.
Note:
The size of the input list will be between 1 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the list will be between -30000 and 30000.
```

#### Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} ops
 * @return {number}
 */
var calPoints = function (ops) {
  let scores = [];
  ops.forEach(op => {
    switch (op) {
      case '+':
        scores.push(scores[scores.length - 1] + scores[scores.length - 2]);
        break;
      case 'D':
        scores.push(scores[scores.length - 1] * 2);
        break;
      case 'C':
        scores.pop();
        break;
      default:
        scores.push(Number(op));
        break;
    }
  });
  return scores.reduce((pre, cur) => pre + cur, 0);
};
```
